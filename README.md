# bulliBot
Bot for Bulli

<h1> Here's how it works ! </h1>

clone the whole repo, make sure you have open jdk and jre installed in your preferred environment.

everything should be packaged and precompiled, so all you have to do is execute the command: 

**From directory location ./bulliBot/**

java -jar target/gs-maven-0.1.0.jar [your token here] 

make sure you provide the bot token in the "your token here" space

good luck, happy hunting
